Light Wave Photoelectric Effect Simulation

A wave-based model exploring the photoelectric effect through
internal resonance mechanisms rather than particle-based explanations.

This package implements a state-space model where:
- x(t): electron displacement from bound position
- v(t): electron velocity
- s(t): internal store/gain (active response)

The key insight is that the internal store's charging rate depends on 
frequency squared, potentially explaining the frequency threshold in
the photoelectric effect through pure wave mechanics.
